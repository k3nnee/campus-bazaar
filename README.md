## Project 3 objective 3 feature
To fulfill the requirements of this objective, we decided to create a user account dashboard. Users can upload a profile page and look at the posts that they have either bookmarked or posted.


Testing procedures:
1. Register a new account
2. Log into the account
3. Under your username, press "Account"
4. Ensure that there are no posts listed
5. Upload a post under the sell option in the navigation bar
6. Do not make a scheduled post, leave it as 0, 0, 0
7. Once you have posted, go back into your account dashboard and verify it is there under posts
    1. Give it a second or two to load
9. Go to the homepage by clicking "Campus Bazaar" on the top left corner
10. Bookmark 2 different posts by clicking on the bookmark icon
11. Go back to your account page and verify that both posts are under bookmarks
    1. Give it a second or two to load
